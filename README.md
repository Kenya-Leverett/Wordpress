I'm going to be creating a custom Wordpress page for fun since Wordpress recquires paid subcscription to develop on their site.

First, I’m going to be recreating my current Wordpress blog, KenyaUpgrade.wordpress.com. Note that I currently have the most plain free theme available, "Twenty Twelve". I won't be using any mirroring sites or software, just good old fashion eyes and fingers. 

After that, I’ll work on customizing the look and feel of the page until it's to my liking.
